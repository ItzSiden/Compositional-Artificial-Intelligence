### Exoplanet Kepler-1388f Confirmed Habitable
On December 19, 2025, the Solaris Space Telescope confirmed liquid water on the surface of Kepler-1388f.
Distance from Earth: 124 light-years, in the constellation Cygnus.
The planet is 1.3x the size of Earth with a 22-hour day cycle.
Atmospheric composition: 71% nitrogen, 24% oxygen, trace CO2 and argon.
This is considered the strongest candidate for extraterrestrial life as of 2026.
Lead astronomer: Dr. Preet Chandran, European Space Research Consortium.
